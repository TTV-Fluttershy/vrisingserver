# "The Barn" vrising server

Set server name in the Docker compose file!

### Docker compose file:
`./docker-compose.yml`
### Settings path:
`./persistendata/Settings/`

### Save files path:
`./persistencedata/Saves/v4/world1`

Update whatever files you wish here & ping Jeremy on discord, I will pull restart. May add a script someday but nothing now.


Don't touch port or other network related settings without asking me! Best practice is to make a pull request and let me verify any changes before we merge.
